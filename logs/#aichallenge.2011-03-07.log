2011-03-07T00:00:07  <janzert> do you have bss03's latest version of the matchmaking page open?
2011-03-07T00:00:10  *** davidjliu <davidjliu!473a6d0e@gateway/web/freenode/ip.71.58.109.14> has quit IRC (Quit: Page closed)
2011-03-07T00:00:17  <McLeopold> no
2011-03-07T00:01:19  <McLeopold> I don't like the "at random" part.
2011-03-07T00:01:25  <janzert> I really don't want to disqualify any submissions after they've entered the contest unless they are causing actual problems with the servers
2011-03-07T00:01:34  <McLeopold> You don't really do that in sql with any effeciency.
2011-03-07T00:02:45  <McLeopold> it's kinda wordy...
2011-03-07T00:02:53  <janzert> since it's only used to break ties getting rid of it shouldn't be effect much
2011-03-07T00:03:11  <janzert> anyway in the future section
2011-03-07T00:03:13  <McLeopold> where do you see disqualify?
2011-03-07T00:03:31  <janzert> it's not in the page anymore
2011-03-07T00:03:44  <janzert> I noticed it in your old page
2011-03-07T00:03:47  <janzert> but anyway
2011-03-07T00:04:05  <McLeopold> that was probably the "functional test game"
2011-03-07T00:04:14  <janzert> in the future section I'd like to get rid of the first choice for seed the seed player
2011-03-07T00:04:15  <McLeopold> I just didn't explain it well.
2011-03-07T00:04:41  <janzert> so the seed is always based on user not submission basically
2011-03-07T00:05:19  <McLeopold> new submission should come first, the cooldown prevents spamming
2011-03-07T00:05:20  <janzert> then you don't need to worry about a pairing/resubmission cooldown at all and spamming submissions doesn't give you any value
2011-03-07T00:05:55  <janzert> any cooldown shorter than the time to play your next match gives you an incentive to spam
2011-03-07T00:06:02  <McLeopold> true...
2011-03-07T00:06:19  <janzert> at which point just go by player instead of submission and be done with it
2011-03-07T00:07:07  <bss03-AFK> The "at random" just means I take the first row the DB outputs.
2011-03-07T00:07:14  <bss03-AFK> That why it is "random".
2011-03-07T00:07:23  <McLeopold> put in an order by and define the criteria
2011-03-07T00:07:33  <amstan> bss03-AFK: ugh.. stop using afk nicks.. irc has /away
2011-03-07T00:07:39  <McLeopold> (which is submission_id, aka timestamp)
2011-03-07T00:07:49  <bss03-AFK> I use the timestamp.
2011-03-07T00:07:53  <McLeopold> nothing happend
2011-03-07T00:08:07  <bss03-AFK> That en I say, If there are ties (unlikely) I take whatever the DB gives first.
2011-03-07T00:08:12  *** bss03-AFK is now known as bss03
2011-03-07T00:08:35  <McLeopold> you can't have a tie with a unique id
2011-03-07T00:09:39  <bss03> I don't think we actually want to prefer thier earlier or later submissions, so I'm hesitant to order by submission_id.
2011-03-07T00:10:06  <McLeopold> a single users earlier/later?
2011-03-07T00:10:18  <McLeopold> or the set of all new submissions?
2011-03-07T00:10:31  <bss03> There's no going to be a lot of ties that are resolved at "random" anyway.  Usually my last comparision is either a timestamp or a trueskill match quality.
2011-03-07T00:11:01  <McLeopold> don't use timestamp, use unique ids
2011-03-07T00:11:06  <bss03> Set of all submissions.  Of course we only want to use the latest submission for most stuff.
2011-03-07T00:12:09  <janzert> where are you using a timestamp that submission_id wouldn't give the same ordering (except in the case of a tie for the timestamp of course)?
2011-03-07T00:12:26  <bss03> Comparing timestamps is virtually required.
2011-03-07T00:12:37  <bss03> Would you rather I went by game_id?
2011-03-07T00:12:40  <McLeopold> yes
2011-03-07T00:12:50  <McLeopold> unique_id's are in order of time anyway
2011-03-07T00:12:57  <McLeopold> and integers are faster
2011-03-07T00:13:14  <McLeopold> I don't want to index timestamps
2011-03-07T00:13:42  <bss03> Well, unique id aren't guaranteed to increase monotonically as time does.
2011-03-07T00:13:51  <McLeopold> btw, I glad you've been putting in the work you have, it is looking good so far.
2011-03-07T00:14:02  <bss03> But, I'm not gonna fight on that point.  game_id or somesuch is fine.
2011-03-07T00:14:45  <McLeopold> I think they are, if I know what monotonically means.
2011-03-07T00:14:53  <McLeopold> you always count up
2011-03-07T00:15:06  <bss03> Now, I really must get to bed.  "Wake up call" in 7 hours.
2011-03-07T00:15:25  <McLeopold> k, cya
2011-03-07T00:15:27  <bss03> RDBMSes are allowed to re-use unique ids that are not longer in the table.
2011-03-07T00:15:29  <janzert> I think they're a reason they're also called autoincrement
2011-03-07T00:15:39  <McLeopold> we won't be doing that
2011-03-07T00:15:41  <bss03> Most don't.
2011-03-07T00:15:44  <janzert> there's
2011-03-07T00:16:05  <McLeopold> the mysql auto_inc does a max() on the table
2011-03-07T00:16:20  <bss03> MySQL autoincrement in particular doesn't -- it just does max() + 1.
2011-03-07T00:17:02  <janzert> which is exactly what we need to guarantee right?
2011-03-07T00:17:10  <McLeopold> yes, so id's will work
2011-03-07T00:17:36  <bss03> Yeah, game_id will work fine.  I'm a theoretical purest though.
2011-03-07T00:17:44  <bss03> Why do you think I learned Haskell? ;)
2011-03-07T00:17:50  <McLeopold> :)
2011-03-07T00:17:51  <bss03> Night all.
2011-03-07T00:17:54  <McLeopold> night
2011-03-07T00:17:56  <janzert> :)
2011-03-07T00:17:58  <janzert> goodnight
2011-03-07T00:18:03  <janzert> again :P
2011-03-07T00:20:59  <janzert> so the main server setup script minimally works installing stuff and setting up apache to serve up pages
2011-03-07T00:21:37  <janzert> but I'm going to wait to add anything about setting up cron jobs until the new scripts are done since it appears they are all changing names anyway
2011-03-07T00:22:32  <janzert> so now I just need to give it a good dose of flexibility :P
2011-03-07T00:24:29  <McLeopold> we still using compile_anything?
2011-03-07T00:24:56  <janzert> on the main server? depends on what you mean by still
2011-03-07T00:25:08  <McLeopold> can markdown blocks be given a language syntax for highlighting?
2011-03-07T00:25:15  <McLeopold> for the workers to compile
2011-03-07T00:25:21  <janzert> it was in planetwars, once compilation is moved to the workers no
2011-03-07T00:25:29  <janzert> yes, I believe so
2011-03-07T00:26:18  <janzert> or it will for sure once the workers do compilation unless we want to fully jump ship and just use compile.sh/run.sh scripts for all submissions
2011-03-07T00:26:44  <janzert> I'm not quite sure whether I'm ready or not to go that far
2011-03-07T00:27:29  <McLeopold> let's assume no compile.sh for now
2011-03-07T00:29:25  <janzert> yeah, then the worker will need compile_anything
2011-03-07T00:31:01  <janzert> are you ok with simply choosing seed players in least recently played order?

2011-03-07T00:33:07  <McLeopold> I would like to try and give players not spamming some leeway, but we can do that later.
2011-03-07T00:33:45  <McLeopold> oh no, but yes

2011-03-07T02:03:59  <janzert> well it looks like it also has safe_mode off and open_basedir none :}
2011-03-07T02:05:03  <McLeopold> yeah, i'm fixing safe mode off issues as well :(
2011-03-07T02:05:18  <McLeopold> not familiar with open_basedir yet
2011-03-07T02:05:47  <antimatroid> McLeopold: I'm unsure about your format for "space"
2011-03-07T02:06:06  <antimatroid> you might end up with losts of (0,1,2): x, (0,2,4): x etc. situations?
2011-03-07T02:06:18  <janzert> restricts where php scripts can open files, sort of a php specific chroot I believe
2011-03-07T02:06:25  <janzert> none simply disables
2011-03-07T02:08:16  <McLeopold> antimatroid: yes, there might be lots of combos
2011-03-07T02:08:34  <antimatroid> okay, well i'll update that in a bit then make everthing functions and i think it's done
2011-03-07T02:08:59  <McLeopold> okay, add_maps_to_database will import the function
2011-03-07T02:09:49  <antimatroid> so could i really just throw everything i have as "main" now into a function called analyze_map?
2011-03-07T02:09:49  <McLeopold> with the combos, I can know how much space player X can get to first, and just as fast as all others, etc.
2011-03-07T02:10:12  <McLeopold> I can just add up the numbers I'm interested in.
2011-03-07T02:10:24  <antimatroid> yep
2011-03-07T02:10:43  <antimatroid> it was a little tricky working out how to calculate who can get where first, but i think what i have now is general
2011-03-07T02:11:02  <McLeopold> I saw the pictures, they looked cool.
2011-03-07T02:11:19  <antimatroid> actually, i need to make a couple of changes to make sure it can handle each player starting with more than one ant
2011-03-07T02:11:23  <antimatroid> i think that's ideal?
2011-03-07T02:11:30  <McLeopold> yes
2011-03-07T02:11:39  <McLeopold> I hope to have multiple start maps
2011-03-07T02:11:42  <antimatroid> they're small changes anyway, just adding a line or two in places

2011-03-07T03:14:44  <McLeopold> so, no squares equidistant to 3 or more?
2011-03-07T03:15:00  <antimatroid> not in that map, but it's easy to construct a situation where it will happen
2011-03-07T03:15:13  <antimatroid> i think i could potentially get 8+ players at an equidistance
2011-03-07T03:15:33  <antimatroid> i'm using shortest paths for players to find "access", not euclidean distance
2011-03-07T03:16:45  <antimatroid> i should probably check that each player has the same number of starting ants and enforce that?
2011-03-07T03:18:11  <antimatroid> boy kinder surprise toys don't require much construction these days
2011-03-07T03:18:13  <McLeopold> just stats, no enforement

2011-03-07T03:18:51  <antimatroid> erm, whenever something has been wrong i've been raising a ValueError?

2011-03-07T03:20:42  <McLeopold> maybe it was old?

2011-03-07T03:21:37  <antimatroid> milo is more awesome
2011-03-07T03:21:56  <sigh> also ferrero rocher
2011-03-07T03:21:59  <McLeopold> ValueError is the map is not valid.  Having extra starting spots can be a valid map, just unfair.
2011-03-07T03:22:14  <antimatroid> i'm not sure whether knowing the center of a ferrero rocher makes that worse or nutella better
2011-03-07T03:22:36  <antimatroid> McLeopold: okay, done
2011-03-07T03:22:50  <antimatroid> center is just nutella***
2011-03-07T03:22:57  <McLeopold> maybe a 'starts' list in the dict then
2011-03-07T03:23:10  <antimatroid> already on it :)
2011-03-07T03:24:44  <antimatroid> can i tell python to take two lists and sort them both but by ordering the first list?
2011-03-07T03:25:06  <antimatroid> or have i shot myself in the foot?
2011-03-07T03:27:39  <sigh> what do you mean?
2011-03-07T03:29:12  <sigh> do you mean this: x,y = zip(*sorted(zip(x,y)))
2011-03-07T03:32:25  <antimatroid> will that just sort y elements the same way it sorts x elements?
2011-03-07T03:32:32  <sigh> yes
2011-03-07T03:32:41  <antimatroid> i'll see how i go
2011-03-07T03:33:52  <antimatroid> poo, didn't sort it how i wanted :(
2011-03-07T03:34:30  <sigh> can you give an example of what you want?
2011-03-07T03:38:32  <antimatroid> sigh: http://codepad.org/O1VS6olf
2011-03-07T03:38:50  <antimatroid> i would want 0, 1, 2, (0,1), etc., not 0, (0,1), 1, 2 etc.
2011-03-07T03:39:10  <antimatroid> your method worked sorry
2011-03-07T03:39:16  <antimatroid> i was referring to the general sort :)
2011-03-07T03:39:34  <sigh> i'm confused
2011-03-07T03:40:09  <sigh> oh ok, you don't like how python is comparing objects
2011-03-07T03:40:20  <antimatroid> i'm not hating this time
2011-03-07T03:40:21  <sigh> you can pass your own compare function into sorted
2011-03-07T03:40:37  <antimatroid> just it didn't happen to work the way that would have currently been convenient
2011-03-07T03:41:47  <sigh> hmm... my python says that 0 < 1 < 2 < (0,1) is True
2011-03-07T03:41:53  <sigh> which is what you said you wanted?
2011-03-07T03:42:13  <antimatroid> hmm i just called list.sort() and got that
2011-03-07T03:42:26  <antimatroid> oh wait
2011-03-07T03:42:39  <antimatroid> try 1 < (0,1)?
2011-03-07T03:42:44  <sigh> True
2011-03-07T03:42:48  <antimatroid> nah, that should be fine, nevermind me
2011-03-07T03:42:52  <antimatroid> hmmm
2011-03-07T03:42:56  <sigh> ok...
2011-03-07T03:45:49  <antimatroid> oh, i am using lists :P
2011-03-07T03:45:55  <antimatroid> my output is using ()'s
2011-03-07T03:46:35  <antimatroid> can i "press" a list into a tuple?
2011-03-07T03:46:43  <sigh> press?
2011-03-07T03:46:51  <sigh> x,y = zip(*sorted(zip(x,y)))
2011-03-07T03:46:54  <sigh> sorry
2011-03-07T03:47:08  <sigh> either convert x,y manually or you can x,y = map(list,zip(*sorted(zip(x,y))))
2011-03-07T03:47:08  <antimatroid> like, make [1,2] = (1,2)
2011-03-07T03:47:15  <sigh> list(x)
2011-03-07T03:47:29  <McLeopold> tuple(list)
2011-03-07T03:48:08  <sigh> i suggested just doing: x,y = list(x), list(y)
2011-03-07T03:48:16  <sigh> clearest
2011-03-07T03:48:20  <antimatroid> that wont help me :P
2011-03-07T03:48:36  <antimatroid> i need to convert a list of lists into a list of tuples, not too bad
2011-03-07T03:48:43  <antimatroid> then sort should just work for me
2011-03-07T03:48:57  <sigh> map(tuple, x)
2011-03-07T03:48:58  <McLeopold> [tuple(x) for x in list]
2011-03-07T03:49:06  <sigh> I win
2011-03-07T03:50:15  <McLeopold> not in python 3 :)
2011-03-07T03:50:36  <sigh> oh, what does python 3 do?
2011-03-07T03:51:00  <McLeopold> list(map(tuple, x))
2011-03-07T03:51:10  <McLeopold> but yeah, i forget about map and zip all the time
2011-03-07T03:51:36  <McLeopold> python 3 is lazy and give you an iterator
2011-03-07T03:51:42  <sigh> fair enough
2011-03-07T03:51:55  <sigh> map is fun but crappy lambdas make it less useful
2011-03-07T03:53:13  <McLeopold> no lambda in p3k
2011-03-07T03:54:04  <McLeopold> dammit, they added back in, wrong again
2011-03-07T03:54:54  <sigh> haha, I was hunting docs to verify that :P
2011-03-07T04:00:01  <antimatroid> now python is just trolling me :\
2011-03-07T04:00:16  <antimatroid> i get the same logic response as sigh with a simple if, but if i sort by the tuples, same result :\
2011-03-07T04:00:35  <antimatroid> me thinks python sort isn't just using <?
2011-03-07T04:00:49  <sigh> it is
2011-03-07T04:00:59  <antimatroid> then that makes no sense :s
2011-03-07T04:01:04  <sigh> paste code
2011-03-07T04:01:27  <sigh> preferably a minimal case that demonstrates the problem
2011-03-07T04:01:49  <antimatroid> bleh, have to reset internet
2011-03-07T04:02:34  <McLeopold> I didn't know he was in control of the whole internet...

2011-03-07T04:06:42  <antimatroid1> well this is annoying
2011-03-07T04:07:15  <antimatroid1> i can't replicate it sorting the way it does with the analyzer with a simple test case :\\
2011-03-07T04:08:27  <antimatroid1> got it
2011-03-07T04:09:45  <sigh> is it this: 0 < [0] < (0,)
2011-03-07T04:10:11  <antimatroid1> yeah i think
2011-03-07T04:10:56  <sigh> not sure how you've got lists and tuples mixed up in the same context, but good luck!

2011-03-07T04:13:51  <antimatroid1> i seriously need someone that knows python to write the "space" output part :P

2011-03-07T04:15:45  <antimatroid1> sigh: did i mention i've made my symmetric maps ensure now that no two players ever start in the same row or column? :P
2011-03-07T04:15:53  <antimatroid1> and i cant start everyone outside vision if necessary
2011-03-07T04:16:09  <antimatroid1> and i can do any number of players in a reasonable size
2011-03-07T04:16:10  <sigh> cool
2011-03-07T04:16:13  <antimatroid1> well, within reason
2011-03-07T04:16:34  <sigh> so the space output part, what needs to change?
2011-03-07T04:16:44  <antimatroid1> the code is awful?
2011-03-07T04:17:09  <antimatroid1> 131 is the line where i'm trying to sort my information
2011-03-07T04:17:25  <sigh> so it works?
2011-03-07T04:18:03  <antimatroid1> you can run that code with the given map and it should run fine
2011-03-07T04:18:09  <antimatroid1> it just wont sort properly
2011-03-07T04:18:15  <antimatroid1> "properly"*
2011-03-07T04:18:22  <antimatroid1> i'm sure whatever it's doing is considered proper
2011-03-07T04:18:42  <sigh> I'll play around with it
2011-03-07T04:19:07  <antimatroid1> :) cheers

2011-03-07T04:39:27  <antimatroid1> it would be cool if SOME of the maps required cooperating with your close enemy(s) in order to not just kill each other right away

2011-03-07T04:53:09  <sigh> :)
2011-03-07T04:54:57  <antimatroid1> while the equilibrium would be a draw, the actual better position would be on the row near the center

2011-03-07T12:19:11  <janzert> was about to say that it looks like you misunderstand and are printing the output
2011-03-07T12:19:19  <antimatroid1> i went to sleep early before, i'll add in ant counts in a minute then i think it's done
2011-03-07T12:19:42  <antimatroid1> janzert: i am printint it, what am i meant to be doing?
2011-03-07T12:19:52  <janzert> all you need to do is place it in an actual python dict and return it
2011-03-07T12:20:11  <antimatroid1> ah, okay, i have no idea what they are, i'll go look them up
2011-03-07T12:20:17  <antimatroid1> (i don't know python :P)
2011-03-07T12:20:18  <janzert> just sec I'll try and edit it on codepad
2011-03-07T12:20:41  <antimatroid1> have you got the link sigh gave me?
2011-03-07T12:20:44  <antimatroid1> i haven't edited that yet
2011-03-07T12:24:35  <janzert> something like this http://codepad.org/5ja5Smwt
2011-03-07T12:25:22  <janzert> also if your editor can do it all the tabs should be expanded into 4 spaces
2011-03-07T12:26:39  <janzert> also just noticed landAccessPlayers should have tuples for all the keys, just change line 126 to
2011-03-07T12:26:59  <janzert> landAccessPlayers[tuple(t[0])] += 1
2011-03-07T12:27:23  <janzert> or actually just get rid of the if/elif all together
2011-03-07T12:28:18  <antimatroid1> so t[0] isn't needed?
2011-03-07T12:28:23  <antimatroid1> cheers for that

2011-03-07T12:30:07  <janzert> the whole thing from 120 to 126 could be changed into a list comprehension
2011-03-07T12:30:13  <antimatroid1> what happened to my accessCounts :\
2011-03-07T12:30:30  <antimatroid1> is that all just in the landAccessPlayers?
2011-03-07T12:31:06  <McLeopold> also, python isn't java, don't use fake reverse Hungarian notatioin
2011-03-07T12:31:09  <janzert> yes, it looks like
2011-03-07T12:31:27  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: what do you mean?
2011-03-07T12:32:17  <McLeopold> Uppercasing all words except for the first one.  but I'm not totally serious
2011-03-07T12:32:46  <janzert> btw, I was wrong about changing to a list comprehension above
2011-03-07T12:33:38  <McLeopold> antimatroid1: it's in pep8, don't use mixed case for new development
2011-03-07T12:34:27  <antimatroid1> that's just what i tend to use for my own programs, do you want _'s?
2011-03-07T12:34:40  <antimatroid1> i don't mind changing that, i'm very indifferent about my variable naming convention
2011-03-07T12:34:47  <McLeopold> if you want to be a serious python programmer, then yes
2011-03-07T12:35:02  <antimatroid1> ^^ I don't, I hate python :P
2011-03-07T12:35:03  <McLeopold> I totally doesn't matter.
2011-03-07T12:35:18  <McLeopold> But read through pep8 and try an use good style.
2011-03-07T12:35:35  <McLeopold> I bet there's a script out there to fix it.
2011-03-07T12:35:54  <janzert> https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki/Python-Style-Guide
2011-03-07T12:35:56  <antimatroid1> i shall, i am slowly picking it up for the sake of my programs here not being as awful
2011-03-07T12:36:18  <janzert> which has links to pep8 and google python style guide
2011-03-07T12:36:42  <janzert> from what I can tell the google style guide is a superset of pep 8
2011-03-07T12:37:16  <McLeopold> the only thing that really gets me is the 80 character limit
2011-03-07T12:37:31  <McLeopold> I'm constantly going over a feel like I'm making my code less readable.
2011-03-07T12:38:29  <janzert> I go over around every few hundred lines
2011-03-07T12:39:02  <janzert> usually when I start going over I use it as an indicator that I need to factor out a separate function or break a single statement up
2011-03-07T12:39:22  <McLeopold> because your indent starts to far over?
2011-03-07T12:39:24  <janzert> or just use python's excellent line continuations to make it more readable :)
2011-03-07T12:39:37  <janzert> if that's what's causing it yes
2011-03-07T12:40:08  <McLeopold> how much time do I have left?
2011-03-07T12:40:47  <janzert> 7 hours?
2011-03-07T12:40:48  <janzert> :)
2011-03-07T12:41:10  <janzert> lunch time, be back in a while

2011-03-07T13:06:04  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: Oh, look at this http://codepad.org/PxNQKauD
2011-03-07T13:06:24  <antimatroid1> there is a square there that 12 people can reach in the same time
2011-03-07T13:06:48  <McLeopold> nice
2011-03-07T13:07:00  <antimatroid1> you can make that arbitrarily large
2011-03-07T13:07:01  <McLeopold> still it on git hub in manager
2011-03-07T13:08:22  <antimatroid1> the count stuff is sorted nicely in the end anyway :)
2011-03-07T13:08:32  <antimatroid1> it requires that if, elif part janzert said to get rid of
2011-03-07T13:08:37  <antimatroid1> otherwise you get a different ordering
2011-03-07T13:10:39  <antimatroid1> McLeopold: do you want me to make a manager directory inside the ants folder?
2011-03-07T13:10:58  <antimatroid1> or just map_analyzer.py in ants?
2011-03-07T13:12:02  <antimatroid1> oh, nevermind
2011-03-07T13:12:44  <janzert> antimatroid1: dictionaries are unordered
2011-03-07T13:13:30  <janzert> the reason I was saying to get rid of the if / elif is that McLeopold wanted all them as tuples of players
2011-03-07T13:13:43  <janzert> even if there is just one player
2011-03-07T13:13:48  <janzert> just for consistency
2011-03-07T13:14:55  <CIA-89> aichallenge: antimatroid epsilon * r22ae873 / manager/map_analyzer.py : added a map analyzer - http://bit.ly/eqrn8q
2011-03-07T13:15:07  <antimatroid1> janzert: ah crap, i just pushed it :P
2011-03-07T13:15:12  <janzert> that's ok
2011-03-07T13:15:20  <janzert> it can be changed later
2011-03-07T13:15:31  <antimatroid1> it needs to check if len(.) >= 1 still though
2011-03-07T13:15:42  <antimatroid1> otherwise you get the wall squares added in there which makes no sense
2011-03-07T13:15:50  <antimatroid1> water*

2011-03-07T15:19:45  <McLeopold> janzert: it appears submissions where stored on the server uncompressed, then compressed when the worker requested it
2011-03-07T15:20:25  <janzert> yes
2011-03-07T15:20:53  *** Accoun <Accoun!~1@static-213-88-2-78.chebnet.ru> has joined #aichallenge
2011-03-07T15:21:10  <janzert> with compilation all done on the workers though the main server should be able to just always hand out the original submission file
2011-03-07T15:22:31  <McLeopold> yep
2011-03-07T15:22:53  <McLeopold> but still test the unzip to get to status 20?
2011-03-07T15:22:57  <McLeopold> or not
2011-03-07T15:23:10  <janzert> I think skip that
2011-03-07T15:23:25  <janzert> it doesn't seem like it adds much value
2011-03-07T15:24:18  <janzert> the worker can always report back that it's invalid

2011-03-07T15:31:58  *** ChanServ sets mode: +o amstan
2011-03-07T15:32:21  <McLeopold> actually, it looks like the get_submission zipped up the zip file
2011-03-07T15:38:01  <janzert> it sent everything that was in the submission's directory I believe? including the original submission file yes
2011-03-07T15:40:04  <amstan> what's going on?
2011-03-07T15:41:00  <McLeopold> I see, I'm not running compile_daemon, so it was never unzipped.
2011-03-07T15:43:44  <McLeopold> the compile daemon unzipped and cleaned stuff up, I'm thinking it should be an unzip daemon now.
2011-03-07T15:44:07  <McLeopold> Also, can the workers send emails?
2011-03-07T15:44:33  <janzert> yes, I'm hoping they can send the success/rejection emails
2011-03-07T15:45:15  <janzert> amazon just introduced an email sending service
2011-03-07T15:46:05  <McLeopold> janzert: after unpacking, the original zip was kept around
2011-03-07T15:46:12  <janzert> right
2011-03-07T15:46:41  <McLeopold> so, I'm thinking, the server will unzip, clean and make a separate tarball for the workers
2011-03-07T15:47:06  <janzert> ok. clean in what way?
2011-03-07T15:47:38  <janzert> I believe we have to keep all the files in case they are data files the bot depends on
2011-03-07T15:47:40  <McLeopold> whatever unpack does in the compile daemon
2011-03-07T15:48:00  <McLeopold> it did a clean because we included tools in the starter packs
2011-03-07T15:48:25  <janzert> ahh, yeah I do kind of remember that now
2011-03-07T15:48:32  <McLeopold> if we change that, we don't need to clean
2011-03-07T15:48:43  <McLeopold> but it would be nice if everything was a tgz
2011-03-07T15:49:08  <janzert> yeah, it does seem rather nice
2011-03-07T15:49:40  <janzert> but on the other hand if we don't nothing on main server ever needs to touch submissions directly
2011-03-07T15:50:02  <janzert> hmm, I guess I'm happy either way
2011-03-07T15:51:25  <McLeopold> I just need to make sure I send the right headers for the worker download.
2011-03-07T15:52:02  <McLeopold> tgz is tar.gz?
2011-03-07T15:52:06  <janzert> yes
2011-03-07T15:52:11  <McLeopold> ok

2011-03-07T16:03:43  <lavalamp> They are interspersed, unfortunately.
2011-03-07T16:03:53  <lavalamp> Should I just delete my fork and recreate it?

2011-03-07T16:05:17  <lavalamp> I discovered there was a problem when looking at the pull request interface... that and the fact that I wanted to add some documentation is why I haven't made a pull request yet...
2011-03-07T16:05:40  <amstan> yeah, np, it happens to all of us
2011-03-07T16:05:53  <lavalamp> ok I won't be able to do anything about this until tonight or tomorrow unfortunately
2011-03-07T16:06:22  <lavalamp> yeah I've never gone through a fork/pull request cycle on github before...
2011-03-07T16:07:50  <lavalamp> On the plus side the debugging .png images the go starter pack can now make are pretty cool :)

2011-03-07T16:08:24  <lavalamp> amstan: ok, will do, thanks
2011-03-07T16:08:58  <McLeopold> janzert: if we don't unpack, how should we calc the hash?
2011-03-07T16:09:28  <janzert> just use the hash of the submission file (on both sides of course)
2011-03-07T16:10:33  <janzert> it's just a double check that the worker actually ended up with the same thing the main server has
2011-03-07T16:13:46  <McLeopold> how would you hash the file in python?
2011-03-07T16:14:56  <amstan> McLeopold: how big? how often?
2011-03-07T16:15:20  <janzert> see submission_hash.py
2011-03-07T16:16:10  <janzert> specifically the function hash_file_sha takes a filename and returns the sha hash
2011-03-07T16:18:20  <janzert> although that also includes the filename in the hash which probably isn't needed or maybe even wanted for how you're using it
2011-03-07T16:19:47  <janzert> btw, if you decide to do any speed testing on this be sure to clear your filesystem caches prior to each test
2011-03-07T16:33:55  <McLeopold> janzert: can you  make the worker setup pull the submission_hash.py file from the manager dir?  That way we don't maintain 2 copies.  Or some github magic.
2011-03-07T16:34:52  <janzert> yeah, I was wondering what to do about that sort of thing in passing the other day
2011-03-07T16:37:14  <janzert> I think the cleanest thing would be to make a separate python package for all the common code to live in
2011-03-07T16:37:48  <janzert> but I'm not really enthused about that either

2011-03-07T17:25:23  <amstan> well.. i got some help from #regex, it's all good now:
2011-03-07T17:25:30  <amstan> >>> re.split(r"<([^>]+)>",a)
2011-03-07T17:25:31  <amstan> ['[16:37] ', 'janzert', " but I'm not really enthused about that either"]

2011-03-07T17:53:28  <janzert> what is the goal?

2011-03-07T17:56:15  <McLeopold> amstan: where's our cia?  I don't see my push?
2011-03-07T17:56:25  <amstan> janzert: to split something like this: 2011-03-06T00:07:00  <janzert> McLeopold: the only constraint there that encourages it from what I see is the no repeat matches one
2011-03-07T17:56:36  <amstan> janzert: into date, nick and msg
2011-03-07T17:56:52  <McLeopold> in python?
2011-03-07T17:56:54  <amstan> ideally with some validation, but not too strict on the date, the date should just go until it hits a space char
2011-03-07T17:56:56  <janzert> I'd skip regex altogether
2011-03-07T17:57:00  <McLeopold> yeah
2011-03-07T17:57:18  <amstan> ideally something like this: http://pastebin.com/nJX5X5TT
2011-03-07T17:57:29  <amstan> that's how i'll use it
2011-03-07T17:57:33  <amstan> but mine doesn't work yet
2011-03-07T17:58:17  <McLeopold> str.split(' ', 2)
2011-03-07T17:58:44  <amstan> McLeopold: i need it not to match lines like: 2011-03-06T16:46:55  *** McLeopold <McLeopold!~Scott@c-98-247-248-39.hsd1.wa.comcast.net> has left #aichallenge
2011-03-07T17:58:47  <amstan> and it has to be fast
2011-03-07T17:59:01  <janzert> str.split should be plenty fast
2011-03-07T17:59:15  <amstan> ok..
2011-03-07T17:59:29  <janzert> I would be a bit surprised if it's slower than a regex
2011-03-07T17:59:56  <janzert> basically just need "date, name, msg = line.split(None, 2)"
2011-03-07T18:00:11  <janzert> then you'll need to strip the <>'s off the name
